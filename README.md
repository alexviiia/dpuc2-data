Data for dPUC 2
===

This repository provides auxiliary data needed by [dPUC 2](https://github.com/alexviiia/dpuc2), namely the context network.  These files are each generated from the file Pfam-A.full provided by each Pfam version.  Since they take a long time, and particularly consume a lot of memory, being generated, it is much more convenient for the average user to download the file for the Pfam version they wish to use.

These files are not included with the dPUC 2 distribution because most users will only need one of them, and all combined make for a large download.

These files were generated with dPUC 2.02. Their format is simple, so they shouldn't change for more recent dPUCs.
